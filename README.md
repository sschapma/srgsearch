# [Seoul Restaurant Guide Search] (http://seoulbuzzsearch.herokuapp.com/)

##This app searches a database of nearly 500 restaurants in metropolitan area of Seoul, South Korea.

###Foreigners living in Seoul have long complained about a surplus of terrible restaurants claiming to serve "authentic" non-Korean food. There are some diamonds in the rough, but they are difficult to find. I took this as my cue to do something about it and make it easier to find quality restaurants.

- First, I scraped data from a difficult to navigate e-book based on a popular facebook group called, "Restaurant Buzz Seoul."
- Next, I compiled all of the data into a database.
- Then, I wrote a python script to search the data by location, rating, and type of food.
- Lastly, I used to Flask to turn my script into a web app hosted by Heroku.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
