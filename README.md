# Seoul Restaurant Guide Search

My first web app.
Was built using Python, Flask, SQLite, HTML and CSS

First step was to create a database of almost 500 restaurants in and around Seoul, South Korea.

Next step was to create a python script to search the database by district, rating and type of food.

Then, I read through several Flask tutorials to turn my script into a web app.

Finally, I brushed up on CSS to style the app.
